# Interaction and Concurrency Experience (ICE) Workshop

Interaction and Concurrency Experiences (ICE) is a series of international scientific meetings oriented to theoretical computer science researchers with special interest in models, verification, tools, and programming primitives for concurrent systems and complex interactions. 

ICE is [since 2010](#previous-editions) a satellite workshop of [DisCoTec](https://www.discotec.org/), generally held in June in Europe.
ICE 2026 is a satellite workshop of [DisCoTec 2026](https://www.discotec.org/2026/), held on June TBD in [Urbino, Italy](https://www.discotec.org/2026/venue).

## 📢 Highlights {#highlights}

- [Distinctive selection procedure](#selection).
- ICE publishes [its proceedings](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/ice/index.html) in [EPTCS](https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~eptcs/)−an [open access](https://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org/) venue−and welcomes oral communications of already published or preliminary work.
- ICE generally publishes extended versions of selected articles in a special issue in the [Journal of Logical and Algebraic Methods in Programming](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-logical-and-algebraic-methods-in-programming).
- ICE strives to maintain a diverse and balanced program committee, and is in general chaired by 4 ["ICECreamers"](#icecreamers) with different backgrounds, geographical locations and interests.

Past proceedings can easily be accessed [through DBLP](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/ice/index.html) or by consulting our [previous editions](#previous-editions).

## 📌 Scope {#scope}

The general scope of the venue includes theoretical and applied aspects of interactions and the synchronization mechanisms used among components of concurrent and distributed systems, related to several areas of computer science in the broad spectrum ranging from formal specification and analysis to studies inspired by emerging computational models.

ICE has featured contributions on Interaction and Concurrency, including but not limited to:

- Formal semantics
- Process algebras and calculi
- Models and languages
- Protocols
- Logics and types
- Expressiveness
- Model transformations
- Tools, implementations, and experiments
- Specification and verification
- Coinductive techniques
- Tools and techniques for automation
- Synthesis techniques

## 🌱 The ICE Selection Procedure {#selection}

Since [its first edition in 2008](#previous-editions), the distinguishing feature of ICE has been an innovative paper selection mechanism based on an interactive, friendly, and constructive discussion amongst authors and PC members in an online forum.

During the review phase, each submission is published in a dedicated discussion forum. The discussion forum can be accessed by the authors of the submission and by all PC members not in conflict with the submission (the forum preserves anonymity of all parties -- ICE adopts a light double-anonymous reviewing process). The forum is used by reviewers to ask questions, clarifications, and modifications from the authors, allowing them better to explain and to improve all aspects of their submission. The final evaluation of the submission and decision takes into account not only the reviews, but also the outcome of the discussion.

As witnessed by the past editions of ICE, this procedure considerably improves the accuracy of the reviews, the fairness of the selection, the quality of camera-ready papers, and the discussion during the workshop.

## 🌟 ICE Outstanding PC Members {#outstanding}

Since 2021, the [ICEcreamers](#icecreamers) select every year a PC member to receive the **Outstanding PC Member Award** in recognition of their efforts and time spent contributing to the quality of the papers they were asked to review, or that they voluntarily reviewed.
