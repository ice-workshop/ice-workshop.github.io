## 🌱 The ICE Selection Procedure {#selection}

Since [its first edition in 2008](#previous-editions), the distinguishing feature of ICE has been an innovative paper selection mechanism based on an interactive, friendly, and constructive discussion amongst authors and PC members in an online forum.

During the review phase, each submission is published in a dedicated discussion forum. The discussion forum can be accessed by the authors of the submission and by all PC members not in conflict with the submission (the forum preserves anonymity of all parties -- ICE adopts a light double-blind reviewing process). The forum is used by reviewers to ask questions, clarifications, and modifications from the authors, allowing them better to explain and to improve all aspects of their submission. The final evaluation of the submission and decision takes into account not only the reviews, but also the outcome of the discussion.

As witnessed by the past editions of ICE, this procedure considerably improves the accuracy of the reviews, the fairness of the selection, the quality of camera-ready papers, and the discussion during the workshop.

## 🌟 ICE Outstanding PC Members {#outstanding}

Since 2021, the [ICEcreamers](#icecreamers) select every year a PC member to receive the **Outstanding PC Member Award** in recognition of their efforts and time spent contributing to the quality of the papers they were asked to review, or that they voluntarily reviewed.
